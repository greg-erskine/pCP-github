Subject: [PATCH 62/65] simple: simple audio overlays for es9023 and pcm5102a

Add 'simple' overlays for simple-card/es9023 and simple-card/pcm5102a
combinations.

eg. dtoverlay=simple-pcm5102a-audio,card_name="snd_rpi_hifiberry_dac"
    dtoverlay=simple-es9023-audio,384k,card_name="MamboBerry"

By default simple-pcm5102a-audio supports 384k. Typically,
simple-pcm5102a-audio would be used with 1st gen HifiBerry 'B' DAC and
Pimoroni PHAT DAC. Both have been fully tested using this driver at all
sample rates and bit depth combos, up to 384k.

simple-es9023-audio requires optional 384k dt param for 384k support.
Default is to limit via codec constraints list to 192k.
This driver could be used with Akkordion, Mamboberry, I-Sabre,
HiFiBerry DAC+ Light and other ES9023 boards.

This is the preferred path for HB to split the 'B' DAC and DAC+ Light
support to separate drivers/overlays. hifiberry_dac path will continue
to support DAC and DAC+ Light at 192k max by default, to remain
backward compatyible.

HB 'B' PCM5102A DAC, to gain 352k8/384k support...
OLD: dtoverlay=hifiberry_dac,384k
NEW: dtoverlay=simple-pcm5102a-audio,card_name="snd_rpi_hifiberry_dac"

HB 'B+' ES9023 DAC+ Light (192k max)
OLD: dtoverlay=hifiberry_dac
NEW: dtoverlay=simple-es9023-audio,card_name="snd_rpi_hifiberry_dac"

For backward compatibility, dtoverlay=hifiberry_dac, continues to work
at 192k max for both TI PCM5102 and ESS ES9023 boards.
