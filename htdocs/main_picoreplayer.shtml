                <h1>piCorePlayer</h1>
                <p>piCorePlayer is a software emulation of a Squeeezebox network music player that runs exclusively on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
                <p>piCorePlayer is designed as a headless music player, much like the Squeezebox Duet. Optionally, a keyboard and monitor or touch screen can be added if desired.</p>
                <p>piCorePlayer uses piCore linux, a very small embedded Linux distribution that runs in RAM. After the initial
                   setup, it only reads the SD card. This gives you a very robust system that, like most embedded systems, is very
                   unlikely to corrupt your SD card. This enables you can simply cut the power without the need of a complex
                   shutdown procedure.</p>
                <p><b>piCorePlayer can be used in 3 ways:</b></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>As a Squeezebox network music player that connects to your existing Logitech Media Server (LMS).</li>
                  <li>As a Logitech Media Server (LMS).</li>
                  <li>A combined Squeezebox player and Logitech Media Server (LMS).</li>
                </ol>

                <p>piCorePlayer is very small distribution, being only about 75 MB in total, including the operating system (piCore linux).
                   It boots very fast, ready for use in about 30 seconds after you power on. Your piCorePlayer will be automatically
                   found by the Logitech Media Server (LMS).
                   It is possible toÂ synchronize piCorePlayer to your other Squeezebox devices.</p>
