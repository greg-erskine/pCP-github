Hi Steen,

I was having problems with my r8712u based wireless usb failing to reconnect to the wireless network when I rebooted.  I had to pull the power before I could reconnect to wireless.

I updated the rtlwifi/rtl8712u.bin firmware file to a newer 2011version and I can now reboot the player and it reconnects every time.

I'd like to ask if you'd update the firmware-rtlwifi.tcz in the image for the next release?
It should help anyone using a wireless dongle like mine.

Product: RTL8191S WLAN Adapter 
Manufacturer: Realtek 

Thanks.
