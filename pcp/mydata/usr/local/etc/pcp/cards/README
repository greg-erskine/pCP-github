The location of the dtoverlay files is mnt/mmcblk0p1/overlays.

Read the available functions and variables in pcp-soundcard-functions:
. /home/tc/www/cgi-bin/pcp-soundcard-functions

Definition of the variables:
----------------------------
CARD:         Defines the audio card name used by ALSA for controlling this DAC
OUTPUT:       Defines the output settings used as default on the squeezelite.cgi page. Like: "hw:CARD=IQaudIODAC"
ALSA_PARAMS:  Defines the default ALSA buffer settings used on the squeezelite.cgi page. Like:"80:4::1"
SSET:         Defines the name of the ALSA control which can control the output volume (if possible)
GENERIC_CARD: Defines which function in the pcp-soundcard-functions file is called when the card is chosen.
DTOVERLAY:    Defines which dtoverlay file is loaded in the boot process
CONTROL_PAGE: Let you use another GUI control.cgi file. So you can provide your own GUI for a new card.
LISTNAME:     Defines the name of the DAC that is shown in the dropdown list on squeezelite.cgi page
PARAMS1 to 5: Defines all the possible parameter that are allowed in the dtoverlay. If PARAMS1 is defined, then this parametr will be loaded by default.
TEXT:         Defines the help text shown in the soundcard_control.cgi
RPI_MODEL:    Defines if the DAC is shown in the dropdown list in squeezelite.cgi dependent upon which RPi is used.
              "HAT_ALL_NO_HAT" defines when the DAC will show in the dropdown list
              "ALL" means avaiable for all RPIs.
              "HAT" equals HAT-DACs for RPi with 40 pin connection.
              "NON_HAT" is for RPi boards with P5 connector
              so "HAT_ALL" will be shown on RPi with 40 pin but also if the RPi model is unknown=ALL

pcp_AudioKernel_status: This checks kernel status.

It is possible to define the variables differently dependent upon the kernel. So if using the Audiokernel version which contains all the patches provided by Clive use something like this:
if [ "$KERNELVERSION" = "Audiokernel" ]; then
