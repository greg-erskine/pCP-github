TEXT="Choosing 384k will enable 352k and 384k sample rates. Selecting bclk_ratio_int_div will use bclk_ratio=50 for 16/24bps and bclk_ratio=100 for 32bps media when sample rate is a multiple of 8kHz and less than 192kHz. Which causes the selection of the 19M2 OSC as the parent for the PCM clock with an integer divider, rather than PLLD with fractional divider and MASH noise shaping."
